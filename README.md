# Random User Generator:

I built a Random User Generator using Next.js that creates random user profiles with just one click. It pulls data from an API and shows details like name, email, phone number, location, and even a profile picture.

## What It Does:

Loads a random user with every click.
Shows user details in a clean and easy-to-read format.
Works fast because it's built with Next.js.
Looks good on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

## How It Works:

The app fetches data from an API (like RandomUser API) and updates the screen with a new userâ€™s details instantly. Itâ€™s a simple, fun project that helps understand how API calls and UI updates work in Next.js.

Want to improve it? We could add filters (e.g., male/female), dark mode, or even a search feature. Let me know what you think! ðŸš€
